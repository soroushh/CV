## Soroush Khosravi

I am a software developer, former mechanical engineer and graduate of [Makers](https://makers.tech), an immersive tech agnostic web development bootcamp with a focus on TDD, software craftsmanship, object-oriented design and Agile practices. I have a keen interest in software development, particularly backend services which is used for both web and mobile applications.

| [Machine Learning Facial Emotions](https://github.com/soroushh/acebook-bcds) | <p style="text-align: justify">For our final project at  [Makers](https://makers.tech), my team of four decided to make a machine learning application in python, using modelled recognition of facial images to identify emotions. We trained our model on 60000 images using a convolutional neural network.</p>   |Python <br />TensorFlow <br/> Keras <br/> Numpy <br/> Pandas  |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/soroushh/acebook-bcds) | <p style="text-align: justify">It was a two week project for a team containing 4 people. The goal of the project was writing an application with the Facebook's capabilities by Agile methodologies. It was my first experience using Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord as the ORM.</p>   |Ruby on Rails <br />Ruby <br/> Rspec <br /> Capybara <br /> CSS <br /> HTML <br /> Travis CI <br /> Heroku  |
| [Makers_Bnb](https://github.com/soroushh/MakersBnB_Need_Sleep_Team) |<p style="text-align: justify">It was a two-week project for a group containing four developers. We wrote a web application in which people can rent the spaces for bed and breakfast.</p> |Sinatra <br />ActiveRecord <br /> Ruby <br/> Rspec <br /> Capybara <br /> HTML <br /> CSS |
| [Bowling game](https://github.com/soroushh/bowling-challenge)        | <p style="text-align: justify">This project is a single page application (SPA) in which you can enter your bowling pins in each round and your score at the end of the each round will be shown.</p>  |Javascript <br /> Jquery <br /> test framework: <br /> Jasmine |
| [Thermostat](https://github.com/soroushh/Thermostat) |<p style="text-align: justify">In this project, a single page application has been written. The operation of a thermostat has been simulated. You can realise your city's temperature by means of an API, then you can use the thermostat buttons to set the room temperature. </p> |JavaScript <br /> jQuery <br /> Jasmine </br> |
| [Rock_Paper_Scissors Game](https://github.com/soroushh/rps-challenge)| <p style="text-align: justify">This is a web application for playing Rock_Paper_Scissors with the computer. You enter your name and movement and compete with the computer selecting a random movement.</p> |Sinatra <br /> Ruby <br/>test frameworks: <br /> RSpec,Capybara |

## Skills

#### Passionate about coding
I found my interest in coding during the automation of mechanical tool design as a mechanical engineer. Then I
prepared myself for taking part in a well_known bootcamp by learning Ruby and I was accepted to the [Makers](https://makers.tech) between a lot of candidates
#### Learning concepts quickly
I learnt Ruby language on my own in two months before taking part in [Makers](https://makers.tech).
Learnt Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and the corresponding testing frameworks during a three month course in Makers Academy and conducted different projects.
#### Problem solving
I worked three years as a production mechanical engineer team in a busy product line with 200 workers and had to solve all sort of problems to maintain the production rate. Being exposed to all sort of problems including technical ones has made me a problem solver person.
#### Persistency
I improved my coding skills in a very technical environment despite being a newcomer in London as the first English speaking country lived in during 9 months. I have been here in London less than two years.
