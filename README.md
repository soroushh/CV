## Soroush Khosravi

I am a full stack software developer; a former mechanical engineer; and a graduate of [Makers](https://makers.tech), an immersive tech agnostic web development bootcamp with a focus on TDD, software craftsmanship, object-oriented design and Agile practices. I have a keen interest in software development, particularly backend services which is used for both web and mobile applications.

## Projects

| Project   |      Overview      |  Tech stack |
|----------|-------------|------|
| [Machine Learning Facial Emotions](https://github.com/soroushh/acebook-bcds) | <p style="text-align: justify">For our final project at  [Makers](https://makers.tech), as part of a team of four, we made a machine learning application for recognition of facial emotions from pictures. In this project we used Python and we trained our model on 60000 images using a convolutional neural network.</p>   |Python <br />TensorFlow <br/> Keras <br/> Numpy <br/> Pandas  |
| [Rock_Paper_Scissors Game](https://github.com/soroushh/rps-challenge)| <p style="text-align: justify">This is a web application for playing Rock_Paper_Scissors against the computer or another player. When playing against the computer, it chooses the movement at random, whereas, when playing against another player, they choose the movement themselves.</p> |Sinatra <br /> Ruby <br/>test frameworks: <br /> RSpec,Capybara <br /> Linter: </br> Rubocop |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/soroushh/acebook-bcds) | <p style="text-align: justify">This was a two week project with a team of four. The goal of the project was writing an application with Facebook capabilities using Agile methodologies. In our application a user can successfully sign up; log in and out; and add, delete, update, like or unlike a post. </p>   |Ruby on Rails <br />Ruby <br/> Rspec <br /> Capybara <br /> CSS <br /> HTML <br /> Travis CI <br /> Heroku  |
| [Makers_Bnb](https://github.com/soroushh/MakersBnB_Need_Sleep_Team) |<p style="text-align: justify">This was a group project with four developers over the span of one week. Here we developed a simple web application allowing people to book bed and breakfast from a given list of places.</p> |Sinatra <br />ActiveRecord <br /> Ruby <br/> Rspec <br /> Capybara <br /> HTML <br /> CSS |
| [Bowling game](https://github.com/soroushh/bowling-challenge)        | <p style="text-align: justify">This was an individual project where I developed a single page application (SPA) for keeping the score in a bowling game. In other words, the application takes the number of pins dropped in each roll of every round and updates the overall score of the player accordingly.</p>  |Javascript <br /> Jquery <br /> test framework: <br /> Jasmine |
| [Thermostat](https://github.com/soroushh/Thermostat) |<p style="text-align: justify"> This was a single page application for simulating a thermostat. In this application you can get the temperature for the city of your choice from an API call, and adjust your room temperature by setting the thermostat accordingly. </p> |JavaScript <br /> jQuery <br />test framework: <br /> Jasmine </br> AJAX |


## Skills

#### Passionate about coding
I found my interest in coding as a mechanical engineer, when I automated the mechanical tool design for the company I worked for in Iran. Then when I came to UK I learnt Ruby by myself in preparation for taking part in a well_known bootcamp [Makers](https://makers.tech), where I was accepted out of a large number of candidates.
#### Learning concepts quickly
I learnt the Ruby language on my own in two months before starting at [Makers](https://makers.tech); and while I was studying there, I learnt Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and their corresponding testing frameworks. As part of this bootcamp, which was for three months, I worked on various individual and group projects, where I got extremely positive feedback on my learning and work from my tutors and peers.
#### Problem solving
I worked as a production mechanical engineer for three years  in a large scale production line with 200 workers at Idaj company in Tehran. To improve and maintain the production rate, I was responsible for solving a wide range of problems including technical and non-technical issues. This experience has improved my problem solving skills, and has given me a good insight into technical and non-technical problems. As an example for non-technical issues, I was in charge of prioritising the distribution of workers in the production line.
#### Communication and training skills
Working part-time as a maths and physics instructor for high-school students has given me good training and communication skills for my technical knowledge. I am able to use different methods of training based on students needs and characteristics.
